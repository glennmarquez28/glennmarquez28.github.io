            <h2>This 20-Something Pinay Revealed The *Exact* Amount She Saved To Move Out And Live Alone</h2>  
            <img src=" img/life1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
            <p>Moving out of your childhood home and living alone is something that almost all 20-somethings have on their bucket lists. Though it can be a scary and uncertain period, it's definitely a sign that you're finally an adult and that you're ready to spread your wings and live ~independently~. But of course, it's a big undertaking—one that requires a lot of preparation that can take months and even years. </p>
         
          <p>One big question that a lot of people ask when it comes to moving out is exactly how much money it costs to do so—after all, it's not something that was taught to us in schools, LOL. If you're in need of a guide, a TikTok creator, @ang.elu, actually revealed the *exact* amount she prepared and saved up for in a recent video. While it's by no means an exact guide one must follow, it's a good reference that can help you as you prepare your own budget.One big question that a lot of people ask when it comes to moving out is exactly how much money it costs to do so—after all, it's not something that was taught to us in schools, LOL. If you're in need of a guide, a TikTok creator, @ang.elu, actually revealed the *exact* amount she prepared and saved up for in a recent video. While it's by no means an exact guide one must follow, it's a good reference that can help you as you prepare your own budget.</p>
          <h2>How much money do I need to prepare *before* moving out?</h2>
          <p>According to Angelu, she prepared two months' worth of deposit and one month's rent in advance by setting a maximum budget based on her ceiling price. She set these aside before even finding a place to live in. Her personal maximum price for an apartment was P12,000, which meant that she saved P36,000 beforehand.</p>
          <p>In the end, the apartment she found only cost P9,000 per month, meaning she was only able to use up P27,000 from her original budget.</p>
         <h2>How much money do I need to prepare for furniture and appliances?</h2>
         <p>Angelu was firm on *not* renting a furnished or semi-furnished place as she didn't want to use other people's items so she had to start from scratch. Weeks before moving out, she did a ton of research on the things she needed and prepared a Notion page where she listed down everything she had to buy. She also went one step further and drew a layout of the possible items she wanted in her place so she could *visualize* how they would look.</p>
            <p>She scoured Shopee, Lazada, and Carousell to find out the average costs of important items like her mattress, shelves, electric fan, cabinets, and kitchen supplies. Once she added the average costs, she started saving up for them. In total, she budgeted P34,300 for her furniture, decor, and home essentials and P13,000 for her appliances. She noted that she made super to *over-budget* as it's better to have more money than to end up having less than you need.</p>
            <p>After buying everything, however, she only spent P31,000 on her home essentials and P12,000 on appliances. </p>
              <h2>How much do I need to prepare for internet installation?</h2>
              <p>As someone who works from home, having a stable and working internet connection was a must for Angelu, which is why she also set aside money for it. She spent P500 on the installation fee and P1,499 for the first month's upfront payment.</p>
              <h2>How much do I need to spend on groceries for my first month of living alone?</h2>
              <p>Living alone means not having the privilege of enjoying your parents' homecooked meals every day (though you totally still could if you wanted to!). Angelu wanted to prepare a budget for her groceries like food and body care essentials, and she spent over P2,000 for this.</p>
              <h2>How much in total do I need in order to move out and live alone?</h2>
              <p>In total, Angelu spent over P87,000 to move out of her parents' home and live alone, though she noted that she lives in Metro Manila and that she had to buy *everything* in her apartment, so this could still vary depending on you and your personal needs.</p>
